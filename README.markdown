SBDataStructures is a (currently) incomplete set of standard computer data structures
implemented in Objective-C. Implementations are often inspired by Robert Sedgewick's
Algorithms class on Coursera, and the [textbook][1] for that class.

As Objective-C classes, every effort is made to preserve the conventions of Objective-C
method names and behavior. Often I look to Foundation or Core Foundation classes for
indication of how a method should be named. Consequently, the API will look slightly
different from the Sedgewick sources noted above.
